# Main Website Content Documentation

In order to be inclusive across language barriers, the documentation and content for this project is made translatable into other languages using the [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) tools which have, as of this writing, been made available in the organization as an application to use for any repository.

GitHub Pages makes use of a *docs* subdirectory in a gh-pages branch as the web content source, to avoid a name collision we use our canonical *doc* name on main.
