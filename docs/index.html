					<h3>The Challenge</h3>
					<p>
						If you have ever noticed something in your neighborhood, near school or work, or anywhere in the Greater Vegas area that could use
						some attention, some pondering, some innovation perhaps, the Smart Smart City Challenge might be what you have been waiting for
						this whole time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Details are not quite final and we will invite input from participants as part of the Early Sign-Ups, but consider
						inviting others to collaborate on an idea, an innovation perhaps, to elevate your community, Greater Vegas, maybe the world. Your team 
						is probably busy with work, school, life, you might not be able to join in on one of these “Hackathons” that sometimes go 40 hours or 
						more on a long weekend.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Smarter Smart City Challenge will last through all of 2026, into January 2027. Take your time. Collaborate when you can. Invite your friends, family,
						colleagues, anyone else to join in. Join in any time, and in fact, anyone can join in right up to the final moment of The Challenge, solo,
						on a team with others, or on more than one team, work on one idea or a few.
					</p>

					<h3>Our Smart City</h3>
					<p>
						Many will say that Greater Vegas (located in Clark County, based more on where people are than formal administrative boundaries) is already a Smart City.
						A Smart Region, perhaps. Could it be smarter? Of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						You, me, everybody, not always at the top of the list of Smart City features. Should a place which is considered a Smart City be building out infrastructure, maintaining services and resources, and always innovating to look after the people
						living within it?
					</p>
					<p>
						We say yes.
					</p>

					<h3>Details So Far</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Any age welcome, guardian permission essential, invite them to join in!</li>
						<li>There will be in-person events, but none required, participate on your terms</li>
						<li>We are seeking sponsors for incentives and prizes (still early)</li>
						<li>Early Sign-Ups for those who would like to join in on finalizing The Plans</li>
					</ul>
